# Annex Marker
---
A simple Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF) program which can be used to turn any provided PDF file into a proper annex (supporting document) for a different document. This can be used for quickly producing an annex for a document with all the required corresponding information as entered into the WPF interface without having to add things such as trademark or copyright information to each page individual. As you might have to do if you didn't have access to paid tools which could do this for you.
